# Python-text-based-adventure
A text-based adventure game built with Python, set in the Mines of Moria from Lord of the Rings.

Welcome to <Lost in Moria>.
This is a text-based game, so there are no graphics and it is played by just typing (the right) text.

This is a non-profit for fun project I am building while diving into my knowledge of Python. It is built with object oriented programming principles in mind.

Enjoy it, let me know what I can improve and have fun!

*Technical information*
The code uses classes for different elements like characters, rooms, items etc.,
The classes and the game itself are in the same file because it is expected to be submited as the final project of CS50's Introduction to Progamming with Python.
